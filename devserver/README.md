# EventLogging Devserver

## eventgate-devserver

This is a backend that uses event intake service and schema git repositories for schemas in the same way that WMF does in production.

### Install

You need Node.js 10 or later. Run the following once from this directory:

```
npm install --no-optional
```

NOTE: When running `npm install`, it is recommended to use `--no-optional` so as to
exclude optional "node-rdkafka" package, which can be cumbersome to build.

### Run

Just:
```
npm run eventgate-devserver
```

This will start an eventgate-wikimedia-dev server listening on
port 8192, writing events out to `./events.json`, as well as trace logging
them and pretty printing them via bunyan formatter.

EventGate config is in `devserver/eventgate.config.yaml`.
The default config uses remote schema repos at https://schema.wikimedia.org.
You can modify these to a local file path of your schema repository.
Set `output_path` to a file to have valid events be output to a file instead
of stdout.

If you are developing schemas, you'll want to clone a schema repository
(likely [schemas/event/secondary](https://gitlab.wikimedia.org/repos/data-engineering/schemas-event-secondary)) and edit `devserver/eventgate.config.yaml`
and change `schema_base_uris` to include the path to your clone of that repository.

### Configure EventLogging to send events to the eventgate-devserver
The following MediaWiki settings are good for a development environment.
You can put these in your LocalSettings.php.

```php
// This is the eventgate-devserver URI.
// Set this to wherever you are running eventgate-devserver
// at an address that your browser can access.
$wgEventLoggingServiceUri = 'http://localhost:8192/v1/events';

// By default EventLogging waits 30 seconds before sending
// batches of queued events.  That's annoying in a dev env.
$wgEventLoggingQueueLingerSeconds = 1;

// By settings $wgEventLoggingStreamNames to false, we instruct EventLogging
// to not use any EventStreamConfig. Instead, all streams will be seen as
// if they are configured and registered. See the EventStreamConfig
// [README](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/plugins/gitiles/mediawiki/extensions/EventStreamConfig/+/master/README.md//mediawiki-config)
// for instructions on how to set up stream config.
$wgEventLoggingStreamNames = false;
// If you do configure stream config in $wgEventStreams, you'll
// need to register those streams for use by EventLogging, e.g.
// $wgEventLoggingStreamNames = ['my.stream.name'];
```

To test that this is all working, you can log a test event from your browser's
development console:

```javascript
mw.eventLog.submit('test.event', {'$schema': '/test/event/1.0.0', 'test': window.location.href});
```

## Legacy eventlogging-devserver

This is a basic EventLogging server that only handles HTTP ingestion and validation.

### Install

You need Python 3.3 or later installed. Then run:

    $ python3 -m venv .env
    $ source .env/bin/activate
    $ pip install .
    $ ./bin/eventlogging-devserver --verbose

### Run tests

    $ source .env/bin/activate
    $ python3 -m unittest discover
